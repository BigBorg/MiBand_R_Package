# Shiny App
My [Shiny App](https://bigborg.shinyapps.io/MiBand/) is in shinyio server. However, I don't have much application running time, only 25 hours per month. If the usage time is running out, you could install my package and call *runExample()* function to run a local version of my shiny app.

To install MiBand package, simply run the following codes.
```
require(devtools)
install_github("MiBand_R_Package","BigBorg")
```

Compress /data/data/com.xiaomi.hm.health/databases directory to create your own databases.zip file or you can also use my built-in data.
